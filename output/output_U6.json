Your largest expenses were in the categories of Clothing ($150), Gas ($65), and Electronics ($89.99). While your spending on essentials like Groceries ($45.67) and Fast Food ($22.99) seems reasonable, you may want to consider reducing discretionary spending on non-essential items. To better plan for retirement, I suggest creating a budget and sticking to it, especially for categories like Entertainment and General Merchandise. Additionally, exploring cost-effective transportation options could help minimize gas expenses.",
